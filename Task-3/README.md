[Mazmorra.io](https://mazmorra.io) has a long history with Colyseus. This project has started to validate the very first versions of Colyseus, when the Colyseus version was **0.2**

I've decided to make the **source code available** for mazmorra.io, for educational purposes. It is not open-sourced under a permissive license, though. You are **not allowed** to host your own version, or a modified version of [Mazmorra.io](https://mazmorra.io).
